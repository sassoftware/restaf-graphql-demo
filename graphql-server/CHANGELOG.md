1. Examples of pagination for SAS Datasets
2. Examples of pagination for CAS Tables
3. Examples of mutation
4. Examples of subscription
5. More examples of schemas and resolvers for typical SAS Viya Application scenarios


## Version 1.2.0

1. Use webpack to build the components for the viewers. This eliminates using inline react components. Also seems to make MS Edge happy.
2. Modify the casWineProduction example to use the more generic casResults.js
3. Added casResults.js resolver for returning custom results from CAS ( Note that in 1.1.0 the casl program returned the result from a fetch action)

## Version 1.1.0

1. Use window.location.replace in the logon.html
